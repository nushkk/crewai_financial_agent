# 📈 CrewAI Financial Analysis Agent

This project simulates a multi-agent system for financial market analysis using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. It models a collaborative team of AI agents that work together to analyze stock data, generate trading strategies, plan execution, and assess risk.

## 🤖 Agents

- **Data Analyst** – Monitors market data and identifies trends  
- **Strategy Developer** – Builds trading strategies based on risk and insights  
- **Trade Advisor** – Plans execution of trades based on timing and pricing  
- **Risk Advisor** – Assesses financial risks and proposes mitigation strategies

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- CrewAI  
- LangChain + OpenAI  
- Serper.dev (search tool)  
- `.env` + `utils.py` for secure API management

> ⚠️ **Note**: You need valid API keys to run this notebook. The keys are not included for security reasons.

## 📚 What I Learned

* How to design collaborative AI agent systems
* Using CrewAI to delegate tasks and manage reasoning across roles
* Prompt engineering for financial workflows
* API key management using `.env` and Git best practices
